**M1 - Develop an AI app with the Microsoft Foundry SDK**


# U1: Introduction

- Developers creating AI solutions with Microsoft Foundry need to work with a combination of services and software frameworks.
	- The Microsoft Foundry SDK is designed to bring together common services and code libraries in an AI project through a central programmatic access point, making it easier for developers to write the code needed to build effective AI apps on Azure.
- In this module, you'll learn how to use the Microsoft Foundry SDK to work with resources in an AI project.
 - `Note:`
	- Microsoft Foundry SDK is currently in *public preview*. Details described in this module are subject to change.

## Learning objectives

- After completing this module, you'll be able to:
	- [ ] Describe capabilities of the Microsoft Foundry SDK.
	- [ ] Use the Microsoft Foundry SDK to work with connections in projects.
	- [ ] Use the Microsoft Foundry SDK to develop an AI chat app.

# U2: What is the Microsoft Foundry SDK?

- The **Microsoft Foundry SDK** is a *unified set of client libraries* designed to help *developers build, test, and deploy AI applications and agents* within the Microsoft Foundry platform.

- Microsoft Foundry provides a REST API that you can use to work with AI Foundry projects and the resources they contain. 

- The core package for working with projects is the **Azure AI Projects** library, which *enables you to connect to A Microsoft Foundry project and access the resources defined within it*. 
- Available language-specific packages the for Azure AI Projects library include:
	- [Azure AI Projects for Python](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-projects)
	- [Azure AI Projects for Microsoft .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.Projects)
	- [Azure AI Projects for JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/ai-projects)

 - `Note:`
	- In this module, we'll use Python code examples for common tasks that a developer may need to perform with Microsoft Foundry projects. 
	- You can refer to the other language-specific SDK documentation to find equivalent code for your preferred language. 
	- Each SDK is developed and maintained independently, so some functionality may be at different stages of implementation for each language.

- To use the `Azure AI Projects` library in `Python`, you can use the **pip** package installation utility to install the **azure-ai-projects** package from PyPi:

```bash
pip install azure-ai-projects
```


## Using the SDK to connect to a project

- The first task in most Microsoft Foundry SDK code is to connect to A Microsoft Foundry project. 
- Each project has a unique _endpoint_, which you can find on the project's **Overview** page in the Microsoft Foundry portal.
[![Screenshot of the project overview page in Microsoft Foundry portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/ai-foundry-sdk/media/ai-project-overview.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/ai-foundry-sdk/media/ai-project-overview.png#lightbox)


- The project provides *multiple endpoints and keys*, including:
	- **An endpoint for the project itself**; which can be used to access project connections, agents, and models in the Microsoft Foundry resource.
	- **An endpoint for Azure OpenAI Service APIs** in the project's Microsoft Foundry resource.
	- **An endpoint for Foundry Tools APIs** (such as Azure Vision and Azure Language) in the Microsoft Foundry resource.

- You can use the project endpoint in your code to create an **AIProjectClient** object, which provides a programmatic proxy for the project, as shown in this Python example:


```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
...

project_endpoint = "https://......"
project_client = AIProjectClient(            
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
    endpoint=project_endpoint)
```

 - `Note:`
	- The code uses the **default Azure credentials** to authenticate when accessing the project. To enable this authentication, in addition to the **azure-ai-projects** package, you need to install the **azure-identity** package:

```bash
pip install azure-identity
```


> To access the project successfully, **the code must be run in the context of an authenticated Azure session**
> 	For example, you could use the Azure command-line interface (CLI) `az-login` command to sign in before running the code

# U3: Work with project connections

- Each Microsoft Foundry project includes **connected resources**, which are defined both at the _parent_ (Microsoft Foundry resource or hub) level, and at the _project_ level. 
- Each resource is a _connection_ to an external service, such as Azure storage, Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI, or another Microsoft Foundry resource.

[![Screenshot of the connected resources page in Microsoft Foundry portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/ai-foundry-sdk/media/ai-project-connections.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/ai-foundry-sdk/media/ai-project-connections.png#lightbox)


- With the Microsoft Foundry SDK, you can connect to a project and retrieve connections; which you can then use to consume the connected services.
- For example, the **AIProjectClient** object in Python has a **connections** property, which you can use to access the resource connections in the project. Methods of the **connections** object include:
	- `connections.list()`: Returns a collection of connection objects, each representing a connection in the project. You can filter the results by specifying an optional **connection_type** parameter with a valid enumeration, such as `ConnectionType.AZURE_OPEN_AI`.
	- `connections.get(connection_name, include_credentials)`: Returns a connection object for the connection with the name specified. If the **include_credentials** parameter is **True** (the default value), the credentials required to connect to the connection are returned - for example, in the form of an API key for a Foundry Tools resource.

- The connection objects returned by these methods include connection-specific properties, including credentials, which you can use to connect to the associated resource.
- The following code example lists all of the resource connections that have been added to a project:


```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient

try:

    # Get project client
    project_endpoint = "https://....."
    project_client = AIProjectClient(            
            credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
            endpoint=project_endpoint,
        )
    
    ## List all connections in the project
    connections = project_client.connections
    print("List all connections:")
    for connection in connections.list():
        print(f"{connection.name} ({connection.type})")

except Exception as ex:
    print(ex)
```

# U4: Create a chat client

- A common scenario in an AI application is to connect to a generative AI model and use _prompts_ to engage in a chat-based dialog with it.
- While you can use the **Azure OpenAI SDK, to connect "directly"** to a model using key-based or Microsoft Entra ID authentication; 
	- **when your model is deployed in a Microsoft Foundry project**, you can also **use the Microsoft Foundry SDK to retrieve a project client**, from which you can then **get an authenticated OpenAI chat client** for any models deployed in the project's Microsoft Foundry resource. 
- This approach makes it easy to write code that consumes models deployed in your project, switching between them easily by changing the model deployment name parameter.

- `Note:`
- You can **use the OpenAI chat client** provided by a Microsoft Foundry project to **chat with any model** deployed in the associated Microsoft Foundry resource - **even non-OpenAI models**, such as Microsoft Phi models.

- The following Python code sample uses the `get_openai_client()` method to get an OpenAI client with which to chat with a model that has been deployed in the project's Microsoft Foundry resource.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from openai import AzureOpenAI

try:
    
    # connect to the project
    project_endpoint = "https://......"
    project_client = AIProjectClient(            
            credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
            endpoint=project_endpoint,
        )
    
    # Get a chat client
    chat_client = project_client.get_openai_client(api_version="2024-10-21")
    
    # Get a chat completion based on a user-provided prompt
    user_prompt = input("Enter a question:")
    
    response = chat_client.chat.completions.create(
        model=your_model_deployment_name,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}
        ]
    )
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)

except Exception as ex:
    print(ex)
```


 - `Note:`
In addition to the **azure-ai-projects** and **azure-identity** packages discussed previously, the sample code shown here assumes that the **openai** package has been installed:

```bash
pip install openai
```
